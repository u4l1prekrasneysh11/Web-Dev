    <p>The castle is perfect if you want to enjoy the scenery the marvelous Bodrum sea creates. Throughout its long history, the castle has been used by different civilizations, and small alterations and renovations you can easily observe in your visit reflect the mosaic-like culture of the area. Donâ€™t end your Bodrum visit without climbing the stairs of this ancient building while watching the sea.</p>
    <li>Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</li>

    <p>The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was a tomb built between 353 and 350 BC in Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) for Mausolus, an Anatolian from Caria and a satrap in the Achaemenid Empire, and his sister-wife Artemisia II of Caria. The structure was designed by the Greek architects Satyros and Pythius of Priene. Its elevated tomb structure is derived from the tombs of neighbouring Lycia, a territory Mausolus had invaded and annexed c. 360 BC, such as the Nereid Monument.</p>
    <li>Theatre at Halicarnassus</li>

    <p>Construction of the Theatre at Halicarnassus is attributed to the reign of the Carian Satrap Mausolos during the 4th century BC. Ancient theatre was enlarged and took its current form around 2nd century AD, during the Roman era. With a cavea width of 86 meters and an 18 meters orchestra diameter, the theatre originally had a seating capacity of 10,000 to 13,000 people.

        The theatre was renovated twice during the 1970s and 1990s by the Turkey's Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Currently the Antique Theatre is being used to host cultural events, such as Bodrum International Ballet Festival and concerts of various Turkish and international artists, with a seating capacity of 10,000 people.
